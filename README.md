## Kinozal-Proxy

This is a serverless function for running a mirror to the Kinozal torrent tracker using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org).

The proxy was created to access the tracker in the [Kinozal-Bot](https://github.com/Lifailon/Kinozal-Bot) project without using a VPN, for this reason, there is an access restriction at the level of checking the agent used when sending requests.

It is recommended to launch your application from this is repository to avoid unnecessary load on one copy, as well as to ensure the safety of your authorization data in the tracker.

The proxy is not universal and needs improvement to proxy to other domains.

## ðŸš€ Using

To use a mirror in the [Kinozal-Bot](https://github.com/Lifailon/Kinozal-Bot) project, disable the proxy and change the server address:

```shell
PROXY="False"
KZ_ADDR="https://kinozal.vercel.app"
```

To access the mirror from your web browser, you can use [UserAgent-Switcher](https://github.com/ray-lothian/UserAgent-Switcher) and import the example configuration in the extension settings:
